React powered tooltip_v2 with Hooks
---

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Change the data displayed in a tooltip by passing the results of [`queryRenderedFeatures`](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map#queryrenderedfeatures) as props to a tooltip component.
